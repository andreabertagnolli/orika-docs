          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
          As  developers we have to provide solutions to business problems, and we want to use the time in our disposition to do what really matter.
 		  In our days, enterprise applications became more and more complex, with a lot of architecture  and design constrains. <br>  Design constraints 
          that will produce a considerable amount of mechanical work.
          A lot of <bold>Open Source</bold> projects put in our hands some great tools to face such        
          complexity, such <em>Spring, Guice, Hibernate, Wicket, ...</em> and we have a lot of choice to pick the right tool to get the 
          job done. However with all of these layers none of these frameworks solve a common problem, present in all Java/JEE applications:   
          <bold>mapping</bold>. 
          </p>

		 <p>
			Mapping code needed to copy data from one object to another, this code can reach a considerable weight, almost time it's mechanical (boring) work, and in the other side consume a huge effort of writing, testing and bugs fixing.
		 </p>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>Orika will do for you the boring work, without tradeoff on performance</p>
          <p>Orika can automatically collect informations about your classes, and generate mappers which can be used together to do copy data from objects to objects, recursively. Orika provide a lot of feature while keeping it simple and open and giving you the possibility to adapt it to fit your needs.</p>
